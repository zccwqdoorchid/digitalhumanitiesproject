This project is for the Computational Literacy course assignment

Research questions:
1. How news headlines reporting violence against women differ in India and Australia news agencies?  
2. Does media coverage frequency correlate with the change of number in violence against women during the pandemic?

Datasets: 
1. The dataset "Times of India News Headlines" includes news headlines from Times of India between 2001 – q1-2022 in one single csv file. The file also includes location data (i.e., city name) of the event reported.  

2. The dataset "A Million News Headlines" includes news headlines published on the Australian Broadcasting Corporation website between early-2001 – end-2021 in one single csv file.
